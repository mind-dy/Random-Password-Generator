# Random-Password-Generator

This random password generator program takes user input of how many characters they want in their password to create a random password using letters, numbers, and symbols.

I developed this project to generate random passwords for people in order to make sure the passwords will keep their personal information safe as it won't be easy to guess. I was motivated to create this project as I often create easy passwords or I don't know what kind of passwords I should use so it would be helpful to have a program create one for me.
